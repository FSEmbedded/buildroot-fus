	  ptp-gadget is a simple picture transfer protocol (PTP) device
	  implementation. PTP provides access from a USB host to a directory
	  of the device and allows the host to load files from and store
	  files to this directory (usually pictures, but basically any file
	  type is possible). Other than with a USB mass storage device, the
	  device itself can still have access to this directory while the
	  host is connected and local changes to the directory contents are
	  immediately visible from the host.
