	  Userspace device daemon. This is a standalone version,
	  independent of systemd. It is a fork maintained by Gentoo.

	  eudev requires a Linux kernel >= 2.6.34: it relies on devtmpfs
	  and inotify.

	  eudev-1.10 is the last version with support for firmware loading,
	  newer eudev version do not support this kind of loading anymore.
	  So if you use a Linux kernel before 3.7 with devices that need a
	  firmware, you might prefer this older version.
